## What information is stored?

- Dtnasty stores your userid if you've found a bug.
- Dtnasty also stores your userid if you were in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/5sWatSkSCY)
- If at any time you were blacklisted, temporary or permanent from our bot, **blacklist information will be stored**.
- When you get blacklisted **your userid, the admins userid, the date, and reason are stored**.
- If you get muted, kicked or banned from a guild, **your userid is stored**.
- If your guild sets a **modlog, mutedrole or prefix, the guild id, channel-id, prefix, and/or roleid gets stored**.
- If you leave and rejoin a guild, **your userid is stored in order to reapply the roles** *if the module is enabled by server administrator*.
- If you set a reminder, **your userid is stored **. It does not store user data which was not provided through a command.
- if you set an afk (away) command, **your userid is stored**. It does not store user data which was not provided through a command.

## Why we store the information and how we use it.

- This information is stored in order to notify the bot **if you're allowed to run certain commands or not**.
- The muted data is stored in order **to keep you muted temporarily and to re-apply your mute if you leave and re-join the server**.
- The banned data is stored in order **to keep you temporarily banned and to unban after the certain defined period of time is over**.
- The prefix and modlog information is used for the bot **to know where to send modlog messages and what prefix to respond to**.
- The mute role information is used in order **to apply a custom muted role when someone gets muted**.
- The profile data is stored in order **for us to put custom information on your profile**.
- The userid is **stored for all of the above and for the express purpose of redisplaying**.

##  Who can read this data?

- **People can only see if you're blacklisted when commands don't work**. The **detailed information can only be seen by Dtnasty Admins/Developers**.
- **All Muted, Mutedrole, Prefix, and Modlog data can be accessed by Dtnasty Admins/Developers**. Only **server administrator/moderators can see their own guild modlogs other if they wish to make it public**.
- **Suggestions and/or bug reports can be seen by anyone in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/5sWatSkSCY)**

## Questions and Concerns.

If you are **concerned about the data stored, or have any questions, [Join the Official Support Server](https://discord.gg/5sWatSkSCY)** and open a ticket.


## How to Remove your data.

**If you would like to remove your data, you run the command `mydata forgetme`.**
*This will cause the bot to get rid of and/or disassociate data from you.
Clearing this data does not clear blacklist data or muted data.*

**If you want more detailed removal of your data, [Join our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/5sWatSkSCY) and request it.**
